# VR-Simulating-Natural-Environment
The unity version in which it was last opened was version 5.5.1f1(64 bit).
A part of IITH has been 3d scanned using photogrammetry and a person can walk in the scanned environment using a google cardboard.
The gvr sdk version is 1.20. One tap walk/stopWalk has been implemented, so you will move in the direction in which you are looking when you tap the screen and if you tap again you will stop moving.
